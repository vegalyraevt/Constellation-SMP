                <h2>About The Server</h2>
                <p>Constellation SMP is the second SMP hosted by Vega Lyrae. It is a follow up to the much smaller "Caked Up SMP" that was a small group of friends and only ran for a few months. After the success of Caked Up and how much the last server was enjoyed Vega put his all into creating this new SMP and rebranding nad rebuilding the idea into something that would be long lasting and include a lot more creators to hopefully create someting much larger!<br>
                <br>Constellation SMP is all about brining creators together to create something fun together while striving to push their content to new places. I hope you enjoy the journey with us!</p>
